# Titanic-Predict-ML

The Titanic dataset provides a rich collection of information about the passengers, it consists of various attributes for each passenger, such as their age, gender, cabin, and embarkation. The dataset is accompanied by a binary target variable indicating whether the passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0). In our analysis, we employ two popular ensemble learning methods: Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) Tree models. RFs combine multiple DTs to make predictions, using power of aggregation to enhance accuracy and robustness. On the other hand, DTs construct individual tree-based models based on hierarchical decision rules. Both methods offer distinct advantages and can provide valuable insights into the factors contributing to survival outcomes.
